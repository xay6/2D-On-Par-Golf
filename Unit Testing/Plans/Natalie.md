Unit Testing - Natalie Morales

I created 3 unit tests which include the following:

1. ScoreManagerTest
   - Verifies stroke count increments correctly.

2. SettingsManagerTest
   - Verifies PlayerPrefs saves the volume settings.

3. SoundEffectsTest
   - Checks if sound effect prefabs instantiate and play.

- All tests executed via Unity Test Runner.
