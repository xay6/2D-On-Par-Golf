Testing Plan

I created 3 unit tests which include the following:

1. ScoreManagerTest
   - Verifies stroke count increments correctly.

2. SettingsManagerTest
   - Confirms the correct float dB value is applied to the AudioMixer.

3. SoundEffectsTest
   - Checks if sound effect prefabs instantiate and play.


- All tests executed via Unity Test Runner.
