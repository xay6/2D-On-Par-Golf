Button Functionality Test: I made sure the button functionality was working when the button was clicked on. 

Coin Amount Test: This test was making sure the correct amount of coin were given like if 50 was given the player received 50 coin.

Hole-in-One Banner Test: This test was to insure that the show success and failed banner were working when called. 

For the report: Open the index.htm, I will open in the users brower of choice. 
There is going to be a lot of information on this screen, but we only need to look at a few test.
1. Find the drop down tab "PlayMode"
2. You should see the ButtonMenuTest, ChallengeUIManagerTest, CoinManagerTest with the results next to them.
