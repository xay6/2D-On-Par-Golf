    "changelog": "### New features\n* Connections can now be made using strings representing domain names or IPs. Hostname resolution will be performed automatically as part of the connection process. (Requires Unity 6000.18f1 or later.)\n\n### Changes\n* ACKs for the `ReliableSequencedPipelineStage` will now be sent a little more aggressively, which should improve throughput of reliable traffic.\n\n### Fixes\n\n* Fixed MultiNetworkDriver not passing the connect payload to the NetworkDriver when calling MultiNetworkDriver.Connect()\n* Added a workaround for a burst compile error that caused iOS player builds not to function properly when burst compile was enabled."
